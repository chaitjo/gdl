I am a first year PhD student in Machine Learning at NTU, Singapore being supervised by Prof. Xavier Bresson. My primary interest is in developing deep learning algorithms on graph-structured data and exploring their applications in such.

Before starting my PhD, I worked with Prof. Bresson as a Research Assistant in the same lab. I have a background in Computer Science and Engineering (B.Tech.) from MNNIT Allahabad where I explored the fields of Natural Language Processing and Multi-Modal Computing.
